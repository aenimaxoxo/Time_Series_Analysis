Suppose we wish to forecast the hourly electricity demand (ED) of a hot region during the summer period.

# Explanatory Model

$ED = f(\mathrm{current temperature, strength of economy, population, time of day, day of week, error})$

# Time Series Model 

$ED_{t+1} = f(ED_t, ED_{t-1}, ED_{t-2}, ..., \mathrm{error})$

# Mixed Model 

$ED_{t+1} = f(ED_t, \mathrm{current temperature, time of day, day of week, error})$

# The basic steps in a forecasting task 

1. Problem Definition
2. Gathering Information
3. Preliminary (Exploratory) Analysis 
4. Choosing and Fitting Models 
5. Using and Evaluating a forecasting model
